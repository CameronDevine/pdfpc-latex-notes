{"name":"Pdfpc-latex-notes","tagline":"Latex Package that allows creating a pdfpc compatible notes file directly from your latex presentation \\notes.","body":"pdfpc-latex-notes\r\n=================\r\n\r\nThis is a Latex Package that allows creating [pdfpc](http://davvil.github.io/pdfpc/)\r\ncompatible notes file directly from your latex presentation `\\note`s.\r\n\r\nIt was created as a result from a [question on stackoverflow](http://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/119191/extract-all-note-tags-from-beamer-as-a-simple-text-file/119267#119267).\r\n\r\nUsage\r\n-----\r\n\r\nDownload [pdfpcnotes.sty](https://raw.github.com/cebe/pdfpc-latex-notes/master/pdfpcnotes.sty)\r\nfrom github and put it somewhere where latex can find it.  \r\nThe same directory as your `.tex` file will work.\r\n\r\nAdd `\\usepackage{pdfpcnotes}` somewhere before `\\begin{document}` in your `.tex`-file.\r\n\r\nYou can then use the `\\pnote{}` command like you used `\\note{}` before.\r\nBehavior will be the same but it will additionally write notes to file in pdfpc readable format.\r\n\r\nWhen running for example `pdflatex` you will end up with an additional `.pdfpc` file that\r\nwill automatically be recognized by pdfpc and displays your notes nicely in the notes section on your control screen.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnything not working yet?\r\n-------------------------\r\n\r\n- It does not preserve newlines, so everything in a `\\pnote{}` will end up\r\n  in one line of the output file.\r\n  To replace newlines and paragraphs you may use the following commands:\r\n\r\n  ```\r\n      sed -i \"s/\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\/\\n/g\" slides.pdfpc\r\n      sed -i \"s/\\\\\\\\par/\\n\\n/g\" slides.pdfpc\r\n  ```\r\n\r\n- Multiple `\\pnote{}` commands per frame are not working right now. This should be easy to fix.\r\n  Will try to make it work soon but are also happy for a pull request :-)\r\n\r\nContact\r\n-------\r\n\r\nI'm happy to receive your feedback!\r\nDrop me a line to mail@cebe.cc or write in github issue tracker if you find a bug.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
